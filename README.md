# meetup_map
This app was built over the course of three major sprints, total to around ~18 hours. (Estimate subject to change)

Originally planned for a 2 week build time, but opportunity arose that required immediate execution. The app is functional and working. Moving forward, refactoring and dealing with technical debt will be important. 

**Todo:**
* Major refactoring of code. Cleaner code, cleaner architecture, & unit tests. 
* Improve or replace date range widget. Need to be able to specific timer faster
